# WiFi Device Scanner

This simple script allow you to perform some task when your device(phone or sth) will be within your Wi-Fi range.

In my case, this script starts music on youtube and opens project in vs code. It is inactive during my sleep hours.

You can run this script in the background using:
  - windows task scheduler(change extention to .pyw and open script with pythonw.exe)
  - windows services and NSSM(https://nssm.cc/) - only work for non-interactive task
  - Raspberry Pi as server
